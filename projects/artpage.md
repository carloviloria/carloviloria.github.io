---

This instagram project is a separate page that showcases art that i've drawn over the years. The goal of this page is to reach out to other creators, graphic designers, concept artists, or any of the fine arts media to collaborate with other artists or people interested in my work. Most of my work is inspired from video games where I interpret characters from my perspective that is then drawn and visualized through various forms of media. My main editing software and art done digitally is done through Photoshop.

It is still a work in progress and i'm hoping to expand into more of graphic design and creating assets for other designers to use for their websites, etc.

  For our final assignment in my last semesters ICS 311 class, we were tasked to form a group of 4 and tackle questions or prompts that we've previously written papers about but to explore it even further. For our groups paper, our prompt was not one of the original questions that we had to answer, our prompt came up as an idea all four of us came up with because we shared similar interest. This was an interest in games with open world environments, hence the image of this project being a game widely known for it's open world gameplay The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. The thesis for this project was to "delve into various aspects and challenges encountered in the development of open-world games such as rendering, pathfinding, AI behavior, memory behavior/loot tables, and quests". Not only that, but we were to describe what data structures and algorithms were used to develop these game mechanics, and there was many but concepts that we have learned previously or during the semester.

  For my section, I was dealing with pathfinding and AI behavior, two key aspects in video games I was highly interested in, and are crucial in making a game immersive / functional to the player.

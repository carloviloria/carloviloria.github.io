Javascript as a complete newbie was a very challenging experience. However, as I started knocking out questions from the freecodecamp site the professor has provided us, I noticed similarities with the syntax of other languages. At initial thought, I surmised that Javascript and Java would be pretty similar seeing that they derive from each other's names. To my surprise, they actually do as JavaScript and Java use syntax which I assume JavaScript has grabbed inspiration from. One example of syntax similarity between JavaScript and Java is the use of curly braces '{ }' to define blocks of code. Here's a sample :

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

if (true) {
    greet("Carlo");
}
```

```java
public class Greeting {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        greet("John");
    }

    static void greet(String name) {
        System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
    }
}
```

In both cases, you can see the use of curly braces to define the scope of the function 'greet' and the block of code inside the 'if' statement which is one of many syntactic similarities between JavaScript and Java.

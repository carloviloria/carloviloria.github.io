## AI'm with you

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has had a significant impact on the way we learn positively and negatively. While it has made learning more accessible and efficient, one of the problems I have encountered with AI is that we may be too co-dependent on it. When talking about its place in software engineering, it is scary how helpful it can be. For example, OpenAI's GPT-3 is a language model that can generate human-like text. It can be used to write essays, code, and even poetry. It is a powerful tool that can help us in our work, but it can also be a crutch that we rely on too much.

## Addressing the Usage of AI in these list of topics we learned in class

1. Experience WODs
- I have no used any sort of AI in experience WODs as most of the experience WODs held your hand throughout the whole process.
2. In-class Practice WODs
- I have not used any AI's for in-class practice WODs as most of it were a group collaborated effort. Any assistance I needed was answered by my peers and vice versa.
3. In-class WODs
- I have used AI in helping me complete the underscore WOD as it was a concept I was not too familiar with. Other usages would be for any formatting issues regarding the specifications needed for style.css and applying it for the Morning Brew WODs.
- For example, I would ask copilot "How do I create a footer with these types of specifications (pasted footer format)" and it would give me a code snippet that I would then modify to fit the specifications needed. Cool thing about Copilot is that it tells you which file to modify and in what area to modify it in.
4. Essays
- Any grammatical issues or spelling mistakes I have used ChatGPT to help me with.
- An example question that was useful is "Do these paragraphs flow well with each other?" and "Are there any grammatical errors in this paragraph?". I try not too ask questions where it would write the essay for me as it would defeat the purpose of writing essays in your own words/voice.
5. Final project
- For the final project, I have asked Copilot to help me create testcafe test cases for the pages on our web application.
- An example of this would be "Using this testcafe example (testcafe code pasted from the assignment page), how do I create a testcafe test case for this page (page name)?" and it would give me a code snippets telling me to paste them in certain areas. The one thing they do not hold your hand in is telling you what files to create, you have to do it yourself.
6. Learning a concept / tutorial
- I have not used AI in learning a concept or tutorial as most of the time I would ask my peers or the professor for help. Most of the modules are pretty straightforward and easy to understand. The information is sufficiently provided for you enough to understand the concept.
7. Answering a question in class or in Discord
- I have not used AI in answering a question in class or in Discord as most of it gets answered before I can even think of a response. If I do have a response, it is an answer that I feel comfortable sharing with the class.
8. Asking or answering a smart-question
- I have not used AI in asking or answering a smart-question as the guidelines help me enough to ask a question that adheres to the guidelines.
9. Coding example
- I have used AI in coding examples as it helps me with error checking and explaining step by used what each line does in the code to help me get a better understanding of what's going on.
10. Explaining code
- I have used AI in helping me explain code if it becomes a bit too cryptic.
- An example question would be "What does this line of code do?" or you could revamp it to "What does this code do and can you explain each line with inline comments" to help better summarize the code.
11. Writing Code
- I have used AI in writing code as it helps me how to write code in a more efficient way or if following any ESLint formatting errors.
- For example "I have an ESLint error here and I don't know how to fix it, how would it look like if I fixed it?" or "How do I write this code in a more efficient way?"
12. Documenting code
- I have not used AI in documenting code as most of the problems I have in regard to documenting code is familiar to me and have no problems solving myself.
13. Quality assurance
- I have used AI in quality assurance as it helps me with error checking and formatting issues.
14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed
- Other uses in ICS 314 not listed was using AI to help schedule which homework was due first and which one to prioritize. Using AI to help me with my time management skills.


## AI tools and me

Before class, I have been using ChatGPT as an assistance tool for any debugging issues or questions I have regarding any grammatical or spelling mistakes for other classes. Recently I have been introduced to Github Copilot which is a handy dandy extension that I use in IntelliJ and Visual Studio Code. It functions the same way as ChatGPT but it reads your code better since it's on the same application which does not require you to copy and paste your code.

</div>

It is safe to admit that I have become dependent on these tools. However, I believe that AI will become more integrated into our lives and work in the future so getting familiar with it is a good idea for me. Rather than using it to tell me what to do, I have been using it in a way that positively impacts my learning which is having it assist me where things go wrong rather than telling me how to do things. It is always safe to do things yourself first before asking AI for help which is the smart way to go about it.

Even now when writing this essay, the image you see above was scaled down using AI to help me find the perfect fit.

## Am AI relevant in and outside of class?

My personal experiences with AI tools in class have been a hit or miss. I favor copilot more than ChatGPT as ChatGPT will sometimes lose track of the whole picture and rather focuses on one piece of information at a time. Copilot on the other hand remembers most of its knowledge and questions the user has asked previously which is a plus. I have used ChatGPT mainly for grammatical/spelling mistakes and Copilot for coding problems. In what I have used it in class, I have used it mostly for the underscore WODs as underscore was a concept I have not been too familiar with and do not see myself using in the future. I have also been using it for error checking, formatting issues when using style.css, and the final project.

It is scary how helpful AI can be in our work. As the years go by the model by then would probably be at a point where it would literally do everything for us, probably when GPT-5 starts to become available to the public. By then, I wonder how the use of AI will impact the generations to come. Will it be a good thing or a bad thing? Only time will tell.

As for its practicality outside of class, AI has been used for many types of media such as art and music. For example, people have been using AI to propagate false information, create deepfakes, and even create fake news. On tiktok, there are videos of people using AI to create covers of songs in their favorite artists voice. In software engineering outside of class, I am not aware of any AI tools that are used in the industry.

## Limitations and Challenges AI've faced

Within the course, challenges and limitations that I have faced were mainly during the JavaScript WODs where the code was not working as intended. I would ask Copilot how to specifically orient things to look like the Morning Brew example image and it would give me a code snippet that would not exactly fit the specifications needed. They would get the picture but not the whole picture. I would have to make minor adjustments to the code to make it work as intended.

</div>

A suggestion I would have for further integration into the usage of AI in the course would be having a AI bot with the GPT-3 model in the main ICS 314 site where it can ask if you have any questions or concerns regarding the course. I think it would be a fun and engaging integration as it can get overwhelming sometimes trying to find everything you need to know about the course and the content.

## Comparative Analysis

The big difference between traditional learning and AI learning is that AI learning gives you the information you need when you need it. In traditional learning, any questions you have would have to be answered by the professor or your peers and sometimes these answers are not immediate, which AI learning can provide. Traditional learning is good for social interactions and building relationships with your peers and professors which AI cannot provide. The information you get from traditional learning is more reliable and trustworthy than AI learning as AI learning can sometimes give you false information. The most important part about traditional learning that AI cannot take away is that traditional learning helps you build social skills which is important in the workforce and in life.

## The future of AI in Software Engineering

The future of AI in software engineering is bright. As the years go by, AI will become a lot more smart that it will become unavoidable to use for students. It will become to reliant to the point where educators will have to tie it into their coursework to help students learn and ask questions on it more efficiently. It is hurtful to not mention the usage of AI's to other students as it will be the future of learning. As we get smarter, so will AI. It will be a tool that will help us in our work and in our lives. It will be a tool that will help us learn and grow. It will be a tool that will help us become better people and will be a tool that will help us become better software engineers depending on how we use it.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the integration of AI into our learning experiences, particularly in software engineering, presents both opportunities and challenges for our current and future generations. While AI tools like ChatGPT and Github Copilot offer immense assistance in coding, debugging, and even writing essays, there's a fine line between using them as aids and become overly dependent. As AI continues to advance, it will undoubtedly play a significant role in education and the industry. However, it's always important to maintain a balance between leveraging AI's capabilities and nurturing traditional learning methods that create social interaction and critical thinking. Ultimately, how we navigate this intersection between human intellect and artificial intelligence will shape the future of software engineering and beyond.

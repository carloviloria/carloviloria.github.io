When asking smart questions to developers or hackers on StackOverflow, it is important to make sure that the question you are asking follows the correct guidelines specified in the site, and also that it follows the precepts established by Raymond. As of January 2024, there are almost more than over 30 million questions and 45 million answers meaning that most questions that many of us have would probably exist on this forum. This brings me to my next point, the one crucial advice that many hackers give when asking smart questions is to make sure the question is never redundant. Redundant questions are those that have already been asked and answered on the platform, to which hackers or develoeprs will most likely ignore for the sake of their time. By making sure you do a google check or a ChatGPT check before asking the question, it saves time for community members who would otherwise spend time providing duplicate answers. Redundant questions are one of many examples of what your smart question should not contain and as we progress through this essay, we will explore two questions on StackOverflow on how to ask questions the smart and non-smart way, providing examples of each for better understanding.

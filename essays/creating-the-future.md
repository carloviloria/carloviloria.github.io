## Building the Future

For ICS 314, we have a learned a multitude of fundamental software engineering concepts that we will most definitely learn and apply in the future should we choose to pursue a career in software engineering. 

These concepts include: 
- Open Source Software Development
- Configuration Management
- Functional Programming
- Development Environments
- Coding Standards
- User Interface Frameworks
- Agile Project Management
- Design Patterns
- Ethics in Software Engineering

These concepts are the building blocks of software engineering and are essential to creating and improving software for the future. As someone who is still getting introduced to the concept of software engineering, this class made me hopeful on what I can do to apply these skills to become a full fledged software engineer. In this essay, I will be discussing the importance of two of these concepts that I feel will be of most relevance to me in the future: User Interface Frameworks and Open Source Software Development.

# Open Source Software Development: A Key Pillar in Modern Software Engineering

Open Source Software Development is a method of software development where the source code of the software is made publicly available. This means that anyone can view, use, modify, and distribute the project's source code. In this class, the source code is typically shared on the ICS 314 website and on GitHub, making it accessible to students and developers worldwide. It is also a way to show your abilities to potential employers and see from the developers perspective on how they code and what they do to help developers understand the code and build off it.

In class, we built off of Meteor templates and React templates that helped us learn about other concepts that were great stepping stones to learning about their respective frameworks. Without these templates that the professors worked so hard on, we would not have been able to learn about these frameworks as easily as we did. 

The important of Open Source Software Development is that it creates a sense of community among developers. We can collaborate, share ideas, and improve code together, leading to a more robust and efficient software. Since the source code is publicly available, users can inspect it for security flaws or bugs which can build trust as users know exactly what the software is doing. Open source projects can evolve and improve at a rapid pace due to the collective input from the community. When we asked smart questions in the discord, a lot of us were able to pinpoint the issues and help each other out. It is also great to know that this is all free for everyone to use and learn from.
